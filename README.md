# ZIP WIZARD - File Handling and Compression System

## Project Overview

**ZipWizard** is a comprehensive tool for handling file operations and implementing basic file compression techniques. It provides a command-line interface for users to create, edit, read, rename, delete, and manage files, along with compression and decompression functionalities.

### Features

- **File Operations**:
  - Create, read, edit, rename, and delete text files.
  - Manage and list all files in the current directory with metadata.

- **Search Functionality**: Locate files by name or keywords within file contents.

- **File Properties**: Display details like name, size, creation, and last modified dates.

- **Compression and Decompression**: 
  - Implementing the LZ77 for efficient compression.
  - Restore files by reversing the LZ77 compression .

- **User Interface**: Intuitive, menu-driven command-line interface.

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive checks for all operations to ensure robustness.

### Programming Concepts Used

- File Handling: Opening, reading, writing, and closing files.
- Arrays and Pointers: Efficient data management.
- Structures: Managing file metadata.
- Dynamic Memory Allocation: Handling variable-sized data.
- String Manipulation: Operations on filenames and contents.
- Standard Libraries: Utilization of `<stdio.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, `<string.h>`, etc.
